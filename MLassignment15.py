# 1. Recognize the differences between supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning.
# 

# Supervised Learning: Uses labeled data to train a model for predicting labels or outcomes. Example: Predicting house prices based on features.
# 
# Semi-Supervised Learning: Combines labeled and unlabeled data to improve model performance. Example: Using labeled customer reviews and unlabeled data for sentiment analysis.
# 
# Unsupervised Learning: Learns patterns and structures from unlabeled data. Example: Clustering customers based on purchasing behavior.
# 
# Python libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, NumPy, and pandas are commonly used for implementing these learning approaches.

# 2. Describe in detail any five examples of classification problems.
# 

# Email Spam Classification: Classifying emails as spam or non-spam. Use scikit-learn to preprocess data and train models like Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression.
# 
# Image Classification: Categorizing images into predefined classes. Utilize TensorFlow and Keras to preprocess images and train pre-trained models like VGG or ResNet.
# 
# Sentiment Analysis: Determining sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) in text. Employ NLP libraries like NLTK or spaCy to preprocess text and train models like Naive Bayes or RNNs.
# 
# Disease Diagnosis: Classifying patients into disease categories based on symptoms or medical records. Use scikit-learn to preprocess data and train models like Decision Trees or Random Forests.
# 
# Fraud Detection: Identifying fraudulent activities in transactions or claims. Preprocess data and train models like Logistic Regression or Random Forests from scikit-learn.

# 3. Describe each phase of the classification process in detail.
# 

# Data Preprocessing: Clean, transform, and prepare the dataset. Handle missing data, encode categorical variables, and scale numeric features using libraries like scikit-learn or pandas.
# 
# Feature Selection/Extraction: Select or create relevant features. Use methods like SelectKBest, RFE, or PCA from scikit-learn for feature selection or dimensionality reduction.
# 
# Model Selection and Training: Choose a classification algorithm, split data into training and testing sets, initialize the model, fit it to the training data, and tune hyperparameters if necessary. Algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, or SVM from libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow can be used.
# 
# Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the trained model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or AUC-ROC. Libraries like scikit-learn provide functions to calculate these metrics based on predicted and actual labels.
# 
# Model Deployment and Prediction: Deploy the trained model to make predictions on new data. Save the model using libraries like pickle or joblib, load it, and use it to predict labels or probabilities for new instances.

# 4. Go through the SVM model in depth using various scenarios.
# 

# Linear SVM: Used when classes can be separated by a straight line or hyperplane. Implement it with svm.SVC(kernel='linear') in scikit-learn.
# 
# Non-linear SVM with Kernel Trick: When classes are not linearly separable, use non-linear SVM with the kernel trick. Use kernels like radial basis function (RBF) with svm.SVC(kernel='rbf') in scikit-learn.
# 
# Handling Imbalanced Classes: For imbalanced datasets, adjust SVM by using class weights or modifying the decision threshold.

# 5. What are some of the benefits and drawbacks of SVM?
# 

# Benefits of SVM:
# 
# Effective in high-dimensional spaces: SVM performs well in datasets with a large number of features, making it suitable for tasks like text classification or image recognition.
# 
# Versatility in kernels: SVM supports various kernel functions (e.g., linear, polynomial, RBF) to handle linear and non-linear classification problems.
# 
# Robust to overfitting: SVM uses the concept of margin to maximize the distance between support vectors, reducing the risk of overfitting.
# 
# Drawbacks of SVM:
# 
# Computationally intensive: SVM can be computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large datasets, as it requires solving a convex optimization problem.
# 
# Sensitivity to parameter tuning: SVM has hyperparameters that need to be carefully selected. Improper parameter values can lead to suboptimal performance.
# 
# Lack of interpretability: SVM provides good classification performance but lacks interpretability. It's challenging to understand the relationship between features and the decision boundary.
# 
# Memory-intensive for large datasets: SVM requires storing support vectors in memory, which can be memory-intensive for large datasets with many support vectors.

# 6. Go over the kNN model in depth.
# 

# kNN is a non-parametric algorithm used for classification and regression.
# It classifies data points based on the majority vote of their k nearest neighbors.
# For regression, the predicted value is the average of the target values of the k nearest neighbors.
# The value of k is chosen carefully, typically through cross-validation or optimization techniques.
# Features should be scaled to have a similar range for accurate distance calculations.
# Common distance metrics used are Euclidean, Manhattan, and Hamming distance.
# Use the KNeighborsClassifier class for classification and KNeighborsRegressor for regression in scikit-learn.

# 7. Discuss the kNN algorithm's error rate and validation error.
# 

# Error Rate: The error rate is the percentage of misclassified instances in the dataset. It measures the overall performance of the kNN algorithm.
# 
# Example in Python: Calculate the error rate by subtracting the accuracy score from 1, using the score() method of the classifier.
# 
# Validation Error: The validation error estimates the error rate on an independent validation dataset. It provides a reliable measure of the algorithm's performance on unseen data.
# 
# Example in Python: Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets using train_test_split(). Train the kNN classifier on the training set, and evaluate its performance on the validation set.

# 8. For kNN, talk about how to measure the difference between the test and training results.
# 

# Accuracy: Measure the proportion of correctly classified instances using the accuracy_score() function from scikit-learn.
# 
# Confusion Matrix: Calculate the confusion matrix using the confusion_matrix() function from scikit-learn. It provides a breakdown of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
# 
# Classification Report: Generate a classification report using the classification_report() function from scikit-learn. It provides precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class, along with average scores.

# 9. Create the kNN algorithm.
# 

# In[2]:


from collections import Counter
import numpy as np

def kNN(X_train, y_train, X_test, k):
    y_pred = []
    for x_test in X_test:
        distances = np.sqrt(np.sum((X_train - x_test)**2, axis=1))
        indices = np.argsort(distances)[:k]
        k_nearest_labels = y_train[indices]
        most_common = Counter(k_nearest_labels).most_common(1)
        y_pred.append(most_common[0][0])
    return y_pred


# What is a decision tree, exactly? What are the various kinds of nodes? Explain all in depth.
# 

# A decision tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It uses a tree-like structure to represent decisions and their consequences. Each internal node in the tree represents a decision based on a feature, and each leaf node represents an outcome or a prediction. The algorithm recursively splits the data based on feature values to create the tree structure. Python provides various libraries, such as scikit-learn, for implementing decision tree algorithms.

# 11. Describe the different ways to scan a decision tree.
# 

# Pre-order traversal: Visit the current node first, then recursively traverse the left subtree and the right subtree.
# 
# In-order traversal: Recursively traverse the left subtree, visit the current node, and then recursively traverse the right subtree.
# 
# Post-order traversal: Recursively traverse the left subtree, recursively traverse the right subtree, and then visit the current node.

# 12. Describe in depth the decision tree algorithm.
# 

# Data Preparation: Preprocess and prepare the dataset, ensuring that it is in a suitable format for training the decision tree algorithm.
# 
# Tree Building: Start with the root node of the decision tree. Select the best feature to split the data based on a chosen criterion (e.g., Gini impurity, information gain). Split the data into subsets based on the selected feature.
# 
# Recursive Splitting: Recursively repeat the tree-building process for each subset of data, creating child nodes and further splitting the data based on the best features.
# 
# Stopping Criteria: Define stopping criteria to determine when to stop the recursive splitting process. This can include reaching a maximum depth, having a minimum number of samples at a node, or other criteria specific to the problem.
# 
# Leaf Node Creation: When a stopping criterion is met, create a leaf node and assign it a class label or regression value based on the majority class or average value of the samples in that node.
# 

# 13. In a decision tree, what is inductive bias? What would you do to stop overfitting?
# 

# Inductive Bias: Inductive bias refers to the assumptions or biases that a decision tree algorithm makes during learning.
# 
# Preventing Overfitting: To prevent overfitting in a decision tree, limit the tree depth, set a minimum sample split threshold, and consider pruning techniques to simplify the tree structure.

# 14.Explain advantages and disadvantages of using a decision tree?
# 

# Advantages:
# Interpretability: Decision trees provide a clear and intuitive representation of decision rules, making them easy to understand and interpret.
# 
# Handling Non-linearity: Decision trees can handle both linear and non-linear relationships between features and target variables.
# 
# Feature Importance: Decision trees can measure the importance of each feature in the decision-making process, providing insights into the most influential variables.
# 
# 
# Disadvantages:
# 
# Overfitting: Decision trees tend to overfit the training data, especially when the tree becomes too deep or complex. This can result in poor generalization to unseen data.
# 
# Lack of Robustness: Decision trees are sensitive to small changes in the data, which can lead to different tree structures and predictions. This lack of robustness can affect the reliability of the model.
# 
# Decision Boundary Limitations: Decision trees create axis-parallel decision boundaries, which may not capture complex relationships in the data.

# 15. Describe in depth the problems that are suitable for decision tree learning.
# 

# Categorical Data: Decision trees handle categorical variables well, making them suitable for problems with discrete or categorical features.
# 
# Non-linear Relationships: Decision trees can capture non-linear relationships between features and target variables, making them effective for problems where the relationships are not linear.
# 
# Interpretable Models: Decision trees provide transparent and interpretable representations, making them useful when model interpretability is important, such as in legal or medical domains.

# 16. Describe in depth the random forest model. What distinguishes a random forest?
# 

# Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees.
# Each tree is built independently using a random subset of the training data and features.
# Random Forest introduces randomness through bootstrapping and random feature selection.
# It performs random sampling with replacement to create diverse subsets of the training data.
# Random feature selection ensures that each tree considers only a subset of features for each split.
# During prediction, Random Forest combines the predictions of all the individual trees through majority voting for classification or averaging for regression.

# 17. In a random forest, talk about OOB error and variable value.
# 

# Out-of-Bag (OOB) Error: OOB error is an estimate of the performance of a Random Forest model without using a separate validation set. It is calculated by evaluating the predictions of each tree on the samples that were not included in its training set.
# 
# Variable Importance: Random Forest calculates the importance of each input feature by measuring the decrease in the model's performance when that feature is randomly permuted. This provides a measure of the relative importance or contribution of each feature to the overall predictive power of the model.
